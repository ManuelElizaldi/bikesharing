# Bikesharing
## Overview of the project
The objective of this project is to make a business proposal for a bike sharing app in Des Moines, Iowa using NYC Citi Bike dataset as a starting point to determine based on a statistical analysis if it's a good idea to undertake this project. 

The project was uploaded to [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/manuel8857#!/vizhome/NYCCitiBikeAnalysis_16179293820200/NYCBikes). In this link you can view the different graphs used for this analysis.

## Overview of the statistical analysis:

For this project we had to answer several questions like: 
- How many customers use this service?
- How many customers are long term subscribers of this service and how many are short term? 

![](graphs/TypesofCustomers.png)
 - Based on the previous Graph we can see that, 433,865 customers are short term users and 1,900,359 are subscribers.

- Of all the customers 1,530,272 are male, 588,431 are female and 225,521 are unknown. 

- We also wanted to determine for how many mintues do customers use the bike for. In the following graph we can see that around 140,000 users use the bikes for approximately 5 minutes.

- We've also included a Checkout graph by gender, as we can see on most men spend 5 minutes on their trips, females also spend 5 and unknown spend 10 :

- Trips by gender graph during Weekday shows that the busiest hours are during 7:00 am - 8:00am and 5:00pm, 6:00pm and 7:00pm. The reason may be that this are starting and ending office hours and most people use Citi Bikes as a form of transportation.

-We did the same graph but filtering by gender, as we can see the pattern is repeated across al genders.

- In this part of the analysis we wanted to determine what hours of the day had the largest demand for bikes, this could also help us to determine when to do maintenance on the bikes:
